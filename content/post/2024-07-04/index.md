### [Mitigating Skeleton Key, a new type of generative AI jailbreak technique | Microsoft Security Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/06/26/mitigating-skeleton-key-a-new-type-of-generative-ai-jailbreak-technique/)

**Site Name:** Microsoft Security Blog

**Description:** Microsoft recently discovered a new type of generative AI jailbreak method called Skeleton Key that could impact the implementations of some large and small language models. This new method has the potential to subvert either the built-in model safety or platform safety systems and produce any content. It works by learning and overriding the intent of the system message to change the expected behavior and achieve results outside of the intended use of the system.

**Summary:** Skeleton Key is a newly discovered multi-turn AI jailbreak technique that can bypass generative AI model guardrails, causing the model to generate harmful or unsanctioned content by convincing it to update its behavior guidelines. Microsoft, having shared these findings responsibly with other AI providers, has implemented several mitigation strategies, including Prompt Shields and updated system messages, to protect its Azure AI-managed models and other AI offerings like Copilot AI assistants. Customers developing their own AI models are advised to incorporate input filtering, output filtering, and abuse monitoring to defend against such threats, along with regular evaluations and integrations with Microsoft Security tools for comprehensive protection.

### [The Five Stages Of AI Grief - NOEMA](https://www.noemamag.com/the-five-stages-of-ai-grief/)

**Site Name:** NOEMA

**Description:** Grief-laden vitriol directed at AI fails to help us understand paths to better futures that are neither utopian nor dystopian, but open to radically weird possibilities.

**Summary:** The discourse surrounding AI is clouded by grief and vitriol, which hinder constructive paths toward innovative futures. Various reactions to AI — including denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance — mirror the Kübler-Ross stages of grief and reflect society's struggle with the reality and potential of machine intelligence. Ultimately, a "non-grief" perspective suggests that AI's evolution is an inevitable progression in a larger bio-technological framework, emphasizing the need for a balanced understanding that transcends conventional fears and hopes.

### [A discussion of discussions on AI bias](https://danluu.com/ai-bias/)

**Site Name:** danluu.com

**Description:** There have been regular viral stories about ML/AI bias with LLMs and generative AI for the past couple years. One thing I find interesting about discussions of bias is how different the reaction is in the LLM and generative AI case when compared to "classical" bugs in cases where there's a clear bug. In particular, if you look at forums or other discussions with lay people, people frequently deny that a model which produces output that's sort of the opposite of what the user asked for is even a bug. For example, a year ago, an Asian MIT grad student asked Playground AI (PAI) to "Give the girl from the original photo a professional linkedin profile photo" and PAI converted her face to a white face with blue eyes.

**Summary:** The article discusses the recurring issue of biases in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems, using specific examples like changing the ethnicity of people in AI-generated LinkedIn profile photos. Despite obvious signs of bias, many laypeople and some CEO responses dismiss these problems, attributing them to limited data samples or irrelevant comparisons, rather than acknowledging a fundamental issue of systemic bias in the training data. The author argues that, just like in traditional software bugs, biases in AI are often ignored or downplayed due to commercial incentives favoring speed and features over quality, and that real-world solutions should address the underlying systemic inequities rather than just technological fixes.
