> According to the Farmers‚Äô Almanac, the phrase originated in ancient Roman times. The Romans noticed that the star they called Sirius, the Dog Star, was in conjunction with the sun in late July. They believed the Dog Star‚Äôs brightness made things hotter on Earth during the late summer months. So, they named this period diƒìs caniculƒÅrƒìs, or ‚Äúdays of the dog star,‚Äù which was later shortened to ‚Äúdog days." - As quoted from *Saturday 17-Aug-2024* **Morning Brew Newsletter**, who apparently got it from the **Farmers' Almanac**
