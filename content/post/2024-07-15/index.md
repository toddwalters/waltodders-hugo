**Omnivore Description:** A bastion host, sometimes called “jump box”, is a server which provides a single point access from an external network
to the resources located in a private network. A server exposed to the external public network (ex. Internet) poses a
potential security risk of an unauthorized access. Special attention needs to be put on securing and controlling access
to such server.

**ChatGPT Summary:** The article explains how to securely access an Amazon EC2 bastion host using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager in combination with Amazon EC2 Instance Connect. By employing this method, the bastion host can operate without open inbound ports, reducing its attack surface and eliminating the need for storing long-term SSH keys. Instead, users generate fresh SSH keys for each session, with access tightly controlled via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

**Omnivore Description:** With the introduction of trusted identity propagation, applications can now propagate a user’s workforce identity from their identity provider (IdP) to applications running in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and to storage services backing those applications, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or AWS Glue. Since access to applications and data can now be […]

**ChatGPT Summary:** The article introduces a CLI application that allows users to access AWS services using their workforce identity from identity providers like Okta and Microsoft Entra ID, leveraging trusted identity propagation to streamline access without needing AWS IAM credentials. It explains the architectural flow of token exchanges between the identity provider, IAM Identity Center, and AWS services, providing detailed steps for setting up the necessary components in Okta and IAM Identity Center, configuring the CLI, and deploying the required IAM roles through AWS CloudFormation. The walkthrough demonstrates how users can interact programmatically with AWS services like Amazon S3, Athena, and Lake Formation using the CLI, ensuring secure and seamless access with automatic token and credential management.

**ChatGPT Summary:** The `aws-whoami` tool provides a clearer and more comprehensive way to identify the current AWS account, region, and user details, improving on the basic `aws sts get-caller-identity` command by including additional information such as account alias and role session name. It requires installation via Go or downloading the latest release, and can output data in JSON format or disable account alias checks if necessary. Users can also create a command alias in the AWS CLI to simplify running the `aws-whoami` command.

Amazon SES has included support for incoming email for several years now. However, some customers have told us that they need a solution for forwarding inbound emails to domains that aren’t managed by […]

**ChatGPT Summary:** The article provides a detailed guide on how to use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES), Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda to forward inbound emails to external email addresses, even those not managed by Amazon SES. The process involves configuring Amazon SES to save incoming emails to an S3 bucket, triggering a Lambda function to retrieve the email and forward it to the desired external address, with considerations for setup steps, IAM roles, and email receipt rules. Costs for using this solution are minimal and include small charges for Amazon SES, S3 storage, and Lambda usage, likely qualifying for the AWS Free Usage Tier.
