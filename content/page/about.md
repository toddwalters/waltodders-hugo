# About

As an Enterprise Cloud Architect at Eli Lilly and Company, I have over 20 years of experience in the life sciences industry, designing, developing, and managing IT solutions across the Enterprise IT Landscape. Eli Lilly is a global leader in pharmaceutical innovation, and I am proud to support its vision and values by leveraging cloud technologies and platforms to enable business agility, efficiency, and security.

I have extensive and versatile experience in Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, VMware vSphere, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, with a focus on creating on-premises private, as well as public and hybrid cloud, IaaS and PaaS services and solutions in highly regulated and quality controlled environments. I have led large scale and complex cloud service development projects, such as the deployment of an AWS account provisioning solution that automated AWS account creation, deployment and configuration based on corporate and industry standard cloud security, quality, and compliance standards and guardrails. I am also responsible for the management and oversight of the Enterprise GCP cloud foundation, including project deployment, configuration and service enablement. I partner with development teams on designing and implementing cloud-native applications and architectures that leverage cloud capabilities and best practices. I hold multiple certifications in AWS and Azure, and I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies and trends in the cloud domain. I am passionate about delivering innovative and reliable IT solutions that support the company's vision and values.
